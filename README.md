# A Simple and Effective Cryptocurrency - Pycoin

This is a simple and effective cryptocurrency project! This project showcases a minimalistic implementation of a cryptocurrency with essential features like transaction validation, proof-of-work, and a basic command-line interface for user interaction.

## Project Overview

We have implemented the following features in our cryptocurrency:

1. **Basic Structure**: We have created `Block` and `Blockchain` classes to represent individual blocks and the entire blockchain.
2. **Cryptographic Functions**: We implemented SHA-256 hashing and a simple proof-of-work algorithm for block validation.
3. **Transactions**: We defined a `Transaction` class for individual transactions and implemented transaction validation using digital signatures and public-private key cryptography.
4. **Blockchain Management**: We added methods to add new blocks, validate the integrity of the chain, and resolve conflicts within the `Blockchain` class.
5. **User Interface**: We designed a command-line interface (CLI) for users to interact with the blockchain and perform operations like creating transactions and mining new blocks.
6. **Testing**: We tested our cryptocurrency implementation to ensure its correctness and security.

## Getting Started
