# A Simple and Effective Cryptocurrency - Pycoin

This is a simple and effective cryptocurrency project! This project showcases a minimalistic implementation of a cryptocurrency with essential features like transaction validation, proof-of-work, and a basic command-line interface for user interaction.

## Project Overview

I have implemented and explored the following features in this blockcahin cryptocurrency project:

1. **Basic Structure**: I have created `Block` and `Blockchain` classes to represent individual blocks and the entire blockchain.
2. **Cryptographic Functions**: I've implemented SHA-256 hashing and a simple proof-of-work algorithm for block validation.
3. **Transactions**: I had defined a `Transaction` class for individual transactions and implemented transaction validation using digital signatures and public-private key cryptography.
4. **Blockchain Management**: I added methods to add new blocks, validate the integrity of the chain, and resolve conflicts within the `Blockchain` class.
5. **User Interface**: I designed a basic command-line interface (CLI) for users to interact with the blockchain and perform operations like creating transactions and mining new blocks.
6. **Testing**: I tested the  implementation to ensure its correctness and security. Chapgpt played a huge role in building testaces

## Getting Started

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the main script: `python main.py`
.
## A Word of Appreciation

I want to extend my gratitude to ChatGPT for being an excellent partner. ChatGPT taught some complex concepts like proof_of_concepts & hashing techniques, built test cases and docstrings among other things. 

Happy coding! ðŸš€
